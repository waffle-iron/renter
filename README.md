15 years ago, Howard Norton formed his furniture rental business in a small rural town in the western
USA. Howard operates an efficient, family run company that focuses on customer service and
individual customer attention.

Always profitable, the business has continued to grow, but is now starting to have a few issues
handling increased business volume.

We are going to automate aspects of the business.
